## Credit and Collaborations

Collaborators: Dylan Ullrich and Yu-Wei Hsieh

## What can books do?

Books are life-changing. They have the power to enlighten, educate, entertain, heal, and help us grow. Build out this code base to create an web app to track what books have impacted you, and what's recommended to read next.

## Development Plan

### Logistical

- What hours will you be available to communicate?

Open to messages at any time on slack.

- What platform will you use to communicate (ie. Slack, phone …)?

Slack for general communication, and Remo and Zoom for collaborative work.

- How often will you take breaks?

Once an hour for 10 mins.

- What is your plan if you start to fall behind?

Meet on on Remo/Zoom, or communicate via slack to come up with a plan to manage time and project priorities more effectively.

### Cooperative

- Make a list of each parson’s strengths.

Dylan: organization, timelines, feel pretty decent with React

Yu-Wei: good at debugging, and following documentation

- How can you best utilize these strengths in the development of your application?

Dylan will be the primary to check organization and deadlines, and Yu-Wei will give final approval on code submissions.

- In what areas do you each want to develop greater strength?

Dylan: Data Structures and Algorithms

Yu-Wei: Algorithms

- Knowing that every person in your team needs to understand the code, how do you plan to approach the day-to-day development?

We will have checks for understanding and bring up any questions during pair programming, and we will do code reviews before daily submissions.

### Conflict Resolution

- What will your team do if one person is pulling all the weight while the other person is not contributing?

If there are any concerns, send your partner a message via Slack to see if there are any areas that the team member could help the other with. If that is not helpful, then we can refer to Sheyna to see how we can best support.

- What will your team do if one person is taking over the project and not letting the other member contribute?

We will call for a discussion to determine how we can contribute to the project more evenly.

- How will you approach each other and the challenge of building an application knowing that it is impossible for two people to be at the exact same place in understanding and skill level?

We will do our best to understand that we are at different points of understanding, and we will do our best to help each other understand subjects that we would like to brush up on.
