# Start your own "Can of Books" App

This repository has starter code to begin work on creating your own online bookshelf.

## What can books do?

Books are life-changing. They have the power to enlighten, educate, entertain, heal, and help us grow. Build out this code base to create an web app to track what books have impacted you, and what's recommended to read next.

## Development Plan

### Collaborators: Dylan Ullrich and Yu-Wei Hsieh

- Exceptions can be made if needed (e.g. we need to work a little later to finish a feature).

#### Communication

- **Collaborative work to be completed in**:
  - Primary: Remo
  - Secondary: Zoom
- Slack will be the default communication for everything else.
- Both collaborators have schedules that allow great flexibility with time to work, so we can adjust as needed.
